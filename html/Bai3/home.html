<span style="color:rgb(155, 104, 10) "> Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>

I've started putting up a <span style="color: blue"> slide show </span> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.

<p>Once again:<span style="color:rgb(155, 104, 10) "> BRAVO!!! </span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
